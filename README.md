# Libro-Sync
This project is an AI-powered Library Management System in Java
It allows users to add new books, view all available books, and get personalized recommendations. The AI feature uses a simple text similarity approach (based on words in the title, author, and genre) to suggest books that match the user’s interest. For example, if a user types “AI,” the system recommends books related to Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. The project is menu-driven with interactive options, making it easy to use and extend.
